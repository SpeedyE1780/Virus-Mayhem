## Minimum Project Requirement
Project 1 consists of developing a 3D Bang! Bang! inspired Game:
- The game features 2 cannons dueling for victory. 
- You are controlling a movable cannon (Player 1), shooting bullets at another cannon placed on the other side of the map (Player 2). 
- The cannon can be controlled by moving it within its area boundaries or by orienting it to the desired direction and shooting at specific power forces. 
- Environment:
  - The map should be created using the Terrain component in Unity. 
  - Models can be acquired from free resources online. 
- At every turn, the camera will be placed above the cannon, allowing the player to aim, once the player specifies the power required (by pressing and releasing the Space button for instance), the cannon will shoot, and the camera (or another camera) will follow the Cannon Ball, only to stop meters before the collision. 
- Each cannon has a Health meter. 
- Keeping that in mind, you are required to use ExplosionForces (Unity Force System) in order to inflict area damage upon hit. 
- The Map will feature several elements such as Powerup monuments, NPC enemies, Obstacles and other. 
- Powerups can upgrade your cannon balls, introduce shields, double your damage, and other. 
- Remember to pick a Theme for your project and let it guide you throughout all your ideas, designs and gamedesign. 
 - The Obstacles/Monuments can be built using small blocks, allowing your cannon balls to destroy the whole structure. 
- Knocking the enemies or powerups to the ground will inflict damage / get the powerup 
- You are also required to introduce a minimum of 2 block types (while building your structures).
- Required elements: 
  1. Terrain 
  2. Cannon Controller (Movemenent and shooting) 
  3. HUD for the game state (health, power bar â€¦) 
  4. Players Turn Based System 
  5. Camera Controller (when player 1 finishes, switch to player 2 and vice versa) 
  6. Environment Objects (Obstacles and NPC) 
  7. Powerups (a minimum of 2) 
  8. Sounds 
  9. Textures and Skybox 
  10. Particle Systems
